# Telco Churn Prediction
Telco Churn Prediction is the practice of identifying which clients of a telecom provider are most likely to discontinue their subscription soon. To accomplish this, it is possible to analyze numerous customer data points, including demographics, usage habits, and customer interactions, in order to pinpoint the causes of churn.

Telco Churn Prediction models can be created by utilizing machine learning algorithms to examine customer data and produce precise forecasts about which customers are most likely to churn.



The Telco Churn Prediction project typically involves:

- Data collection
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Model evaluation

The project's ultimate product is a predictive model that may be used to spot consumers who are at risk and take preventative measures to keep them as clients.
